# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
# 
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# In[ ]:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()


# ### Question 0 (Example)
# 
# What is the first country in df?
# 
# *This function should return a Series.*

# In[ ]:

# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero() 


# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[ ]:

def answer_one():
    df2 = df['Gold']
    return df2.idxmax()


# ### Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[ ]:

def answer_two():
    df['Gold Medals Diff'] = abs(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1'])
    df2 = df['Gold Medals Diff']
    return df2.idxmax()


# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 
# 
# $$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$
# 
# Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[ ]:

def answer_three():
    # select only countries with atleast one gold medal in Summer and Winter games
    df2 = df[ (df['Gold'] > 0) & (df['Gold.1'] > 0) ]
    # compute relative difference
    df3 = df2['Gold Medals Diff'] / df2['Gold.2']
    return df3.idxmax()


# ### Question 4
# Write a function to update the dataframe to include a new column called "Points" 
# which is a weighted value where each gold medal counts for 3 points, 
# silver medals for 2 points, and bronze mdeals for 1 point. The function 
# should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.
# 
# *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

# In[ ]:

def answer_four():
    df['Points'] = (df['Gold.2'] * 3) + (df['Silver.2'] * 2) + df['Bronze.2']
    return df['Points']


# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/CO-EST2015-alldata.html). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/files/CO-EST2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
# 
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
# 
# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[ ]:

census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()


# In[ ]:

def answer_five():
    # crete a multi-level index with STNAME and CTYNAME
    cdf = census_df.set_index(['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'])
    # use SUMLEV column to count for the number of countines. Any other column 
    # wihtout NAs would work as good. We are including the state itself in this
    # counting, as it is the first row in every state's counties
    cdf_slev_50 = cdf[cdf['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    cdf_slev_50 = cdf['SUMLEV']
    countys_in_state = cdf_slev_50.count(level='STNAME')
    return countys_in_state.idxmax()
    
#    gb = census_df.groupby(by='STNAME')
#    gbctycnt = gb.CTYNAME.count()
#   return gbctycnt.idxmax()

# ### Question 6
# Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state, what are the 
# three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)?
# 
# *This function should return a list of string values.*

# In[ ]:

def answer_six():
    # crete a multi-level index with STNAME and CTYNAME
    cdf = census_df.set_index(['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'])
    # a data frame to store the sum of top 3 populus counties in a given state
    top3pop = pd.DataFrame([], index=[], columns=['T3Sum'])
    # iterate over the data frame grouped by state names
    for stname, sub_df in cdf.groupby(level='STNAME') :
        sdf = sub_df['CENSUS2010POP'].nlargest(n=4)
        print(sdf.head())
        # the row 0 is the state itself, so we pick the rows 1...3
        top3pop.loc[stname] = sdf[1:4].sum()
    # pick the top 3 states with the largest sum of their top 3 populus counties
    t3 = top3pop.nlargest(n=3, columns=['T3Sum'])
    # the result needs to be a list
    ret_val = t3.index.values.tolist()
    #print(type(ret_val))
    return ret_val


# ### Question 7
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the 
# period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 
# through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# 
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 
# 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would 
# be |130-80| = 50.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[ ]:

def answer_seven():
    import numpy as np
    # crete a multi-level index with STNAME and CTYNAME
    cdf = census_df.set_index(['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'])
    
    # remove all states from the list    
    cdf = cdf[cdf['SUMLEV'] != 40]
    
    # keep only the columns we need
    cdf = cdf[['POPESTIMATE2010','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2012', 'POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2014', 'POPESTIMATE2015' ]]
    # a new dataframe to keep our absolute populate change between 2010 and 2015
    popchg = pd.DataFrame([], index=[], columns=['POPCHANGE10TO15'])
    # iterate through all rows (state, county) 
    for index, row in cdf.iterrows() :
        rmin = row.min()
        rmax = row.max()
        # create index names with state name as prefix to take care of duplicate
        # county names across states
        idx = index[0] + '_' + index[1]
        popchg.loc[idx] = np.abs(rmax - rmin)
    # end loop
    
    ret_val = popchg['POPCHANGE10TO15'].idxmax()
    # split to retrieve the county name
    ret_val = ret_val.split(sep='_')
    #print(popchg.loc['Texas_Harris County', 'POPCHANGE10TO15'])
    return ret_val[1]


# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using 
# the "REGION" column. 
# 
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose 
# name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than 
# their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# 
# *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the 
# columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the 
# census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

# In[ ]:

def answer_eight():
    cdf = census_df[ (census_df['REGION'] == 1) | (census_df['REGION'] == 2) ]
